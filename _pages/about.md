I am a fourth year CS PhD candidate in [Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences](fens.sabanciuniv.edu/en) at [Sabanci University](www.sabanciuniv.edu/en/), Istanbul, Turkey. Currently, I am a research assistant at [Behavioral Analytics and Visualization Lab (BAVLAB)](analyticslab.sabanciuniv.edu) where I am supervised by [Prof. Selim Balcisoy](https://fens.sabanciuniv.edu/en/faculty-members/detail/746).

Previously, I was a visiting student at [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/) and worked with [Prof. Alex 'Sandy' Pentland](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/sandy/overview/) between September 2022 and February 2023.


My research interests focus on computational social science to tackle pressing societal issues by analyzing *large-scale human behavior data*. In particular, I am making use of both *individual and group mobility patterns* in urban settings to develop data-driven solutions. My research is at the intersection of *urban informatics*, *network science* and *machine learning*.
